# About

This forum is for and by the [Merveilles](https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/merveilles.html)
community.

The [forum software](https://github.com/cblgh/cerca) itself was created from scratch by
[cblgh](https://cblgh.org) at the start of 2022, after a long time of pining for a new wave of
forums hangs.

## Code of conduct
